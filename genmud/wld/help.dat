Then you make a list of edescs. 

gen: These words go in the gen edesc if you want.
	base: This is a base item (raw material).
	noname: Don't generate a series of objects based on different
	types. Just make one thing. Like forge vs granite forge.
	plural: Object shows up as "some foo" instead of "a/an foo"

names: List of names (used on base raw materials only) to generate
	many of these kinds of objects.

process: This isn't literally called process, but it's called whatever
	you want like mine, smelt, build etc... It has a list of
	ingredients needed to make the object.

	hold/wield/wear: You must wear/wield this item.

	make <number>: Make a certain number of things instead of
	just one.

	here/use/made <number> item [in <item2>]:
	Here just says the item has to be here.
	Use and made actually use up the item. The reason for the
	difference is that the made argument tells what prefixes
	may be put onto the item based on the prefixes on the raw
	materials used.
	The item can also be put into another item if you want.

	Special args:
		corpse: requires a corpse to be in the room.
		water: Requires a drink container someplace.
		Can specify what kind of container must contain water.

$9Remember this: The crafted item MUST have a "made" line or be a base
item or the game won't be able to make the item, since it won't be
able to search back to find its "base prototype".$7

However the breaking came. The legion of nations of the world were

You put the name, the plural name and the adjective name into the

For example: elf elves elven go into the name field, wood goes
into the short desc field.

If you put anything into the short desc field and you want a
society made with no adjective, you must put the word noadj
into the short desc field or else the society without the
adjective will not get made. 

Add any flags you want to the flags for this thing.
 
The base flags added to the thing are settler, fixed_align, xenophobic
and aggressive. If you set society flags on this thing, then
they're XORed with those flags autoset, so if you want to
remove any of the base flags, then add them to your list. 

When society_generate is called, there can't be any generated
societies in the game. If there are, do society clearall and then
you can generate the societies which then makes up the new societies.

$9Having these things generated is important since a great deal
of the other generation code relies on this for lists of race
names...like if I need a "bandit" I will go to the society list
to get the name of a race for that bandit rather than having
some secondary list which has the same data in it.$7

Key CAVEGEN`
Admin `
Text Syntax: cavegen max_x max_y max_z

OR

cavegen num_rooms

(and the max_x max_y max_z get set)

This code is used when creating underground areas. It works by having
several levels of space available, and then seeding a 3d lattice with
a few rooms. From there, the rooms grow out so they don't touch with
each other that much. It also tries to avoid making U/D 
connections until it needs to. 

CAVEGEN DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK. Be careful if you mess with the algorithm
since it can flail around for a long time before finding something
that will work.

Also, be aware that the caves created have some patterns in them
that players may recognize. What I mean by this is if you have a 
3 level cave, it seems like levels 1 and 3 are very similar and level 2
is usually the "inverse" or "dual" cave to the other two (up to the
few u/d connections that get made).

When used within the areagen code to make underground areas, the
game replaces mapgen with this code, and then the area gets
filled in as normal with all of the details in the areagen code.

Key DETAILGEN`
Admin This should really be admin only.

`
Text The "area details area" contains things that serve as prototypes for
small "mini-areas" to be found within areas to flesh them out.
The idea is normally to have a room or rooms placed into the
area (as the rooms are randomly chosen from the first 200? in the
area, and then more details are added within that.

For cases where you want a room to just have an object, you can
set the room to have a name called "same_name" as some of the details do,
and then reset an object inside of that. The reset object is then
what's actually created in the area.

The parsing and grammars work the same as they do in the
mobgen and citygen code.

This is actually the first really recursive generation code I wrote
since it seemed easier than the citygen code which really sucks and
is really hard.

So, if you look at the detailgen code and the citygen code you will
notice a lot of similarities, but the citygen code is capable of more
things at this point.

The idea is you create base objects that will get tested to see
if they get plopped into the area, then add resets to those objects
and the reset objects add more details within the previous details
and so forth.

Text syntax:

The citygen code tries to create cities or perhaps individual buildings
recursively. It's sort of a second attempt at the detailgen code
and shares many similarities.

The idea is to create a city by going down a list of resets inside the
first obj in the citygen setup area, then recursively add details until
the city is filled up. As with all of the other generators, you 
make things that have lists of words and attributes in them, then
you use the generator to instantiate actual prototypes. This allows
for randpop things, as well, so say if you want "a store" of some kind
in an area, you can make a randpop item that chooses one store and
places it there. Or if you have 10 kinds of "citizens" you can choose
one of them if you wish.

If you make a 2 handed wpn I guess the damage can go up to around

low power 2 handed wpns if you make the good ones.

Armors, 1 pt = bad, 8-9 pts = really good. Again, pop on mobs
level = 10x the armor.

Only make a few +dam/+stat items per area. Never have more than
+1dam/+1stat ever. Not even if the item has "massive penalties"
or is "impossible to get". These should be on level 100+ mobs
at low low pcts.

Hps/mvs can go from +1 up to +10 or so, again with a multiplier of
10 levels per +.

Stuff like kickdam/spellattack/hitroll should go from about +1 to
+3-4 max...with the mob at least 30x the + amount.

Items cannot have more than 1-2 plusses, and if you have two of them,
at least one of the plusses must be a crappy one like hps or
mv or hitroll, and even then, it must be lower in power than it

Key IMPLANT IMPLANTS`
Admin `
Text Implants are extra bonuses you can obtain for your character.
You must find the implant room and go there with enough money,
levels, remorts and warpoints to get an implant.

There are 4 types of implants: head, body, arms and legs (corresponding)
to the various body parts you can have.

You can get up to 7 tiers in each implant, and you can find out
the costs for each tier by typing implant costs. You get 6 "implant points"
per remort, which work like guild points in that it costs N implant
points to go from tier N-1 to N in any implant category.

That means it takes 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 28 implant points to max one implant.

You get 66 total points, so you can either get 2 implants maxxed, or you
can get (essentially) all 4 types of implants up to tier 5, along
with one tier 6. I might change this at some point since I just realized
how lame it would be to get a tier 7 implant. I might make it so
the max implant point cost is something like 5 points...but it costs
more gold and warpoints. But that's for later. 

To get a list of the implant costs, type

implant costs

The tiers you can afford right now are listed as green numbers, and the 
ones you can't afford are red.

If you type 

implant <head/body/arms/legs> you will try to advance your implant
of that type one tier.

Head implants help you cast better, and help you to resist magic.
Body implants give you armor against physical attacks.
Arm implants let you hit harder in combat.
Leg implants let you kick harder and move farther before tiring.

When you cast an area spell, it requires more mana, more time to

does less damage, and has a smaller chance of putting an affect on
the victim. 

It is possible for powerful wizards to cast ranged spells, or
even ranged area spells, and ranged spells behave similarly to
area spells in that they are harder to cast, and weaker once
they take effect. Ranged area spells have much less power than

Key SOCIAL SOCIALS`
Admin Editing socials is easy. I don't really care too much about
socials, but they do add atmosphere, so I added them in. In doing so,
I did them in the easiest way possible. You need to edit socials.dat
offline. There is no online editor because a) it's easy to do it
offline and b) you really shouldn't be changing socials TOO often, and
c) they aren't really an integral part of the game, so they can wait
for the next reboot.

A social has 3 strings in it.

The first string is the social word itself like "bow" followed by the
backwards quote.

The second string is the "no argument" string and looks like this:

@1n bow@s down deeply.

The third string is the "victim" string and looks like this:

@1n bow@s down before @3n.

Note that this editing uses act () so help ACT to see how it works.

You can reload socials by typing social reload.

`
Text Socials are little commands you can type in that send messages to
everything in the same room as you. Generally, you can do <socialname>
without an argument, and <socialname> <person name> to do the social
onto that person. This fails if the person you are looking for is not
here.


Eg.

If you want padding you can add numbers.

putting a - in front of a number makes the text left justified, 
putting a ! in front of it, makes it centered, and a regular number
will just right justify the text with that much padding.

For example, if your name is "lonath" and you want to have padding a
total of 20 characters (which is the max padding allowed) around
your name, you can do

@20nm@ 

which will make 14 spaces then put your name down like so:

              lonath

If you want left justified, do

@-20nm@ 

which will make your name and then put 14 blank spaces after it like so:

lonath             |---- first space after the name.

If you want it centered, do

@!20nm@ 

which will put 7 spaces before and after your name (if the padding is
uneven on a centered string, the extra character goes first).

       lonath       |---- first available space.

Key SOCIETY SOCIETIES SOCI_FLAGS SOCIETY_FLAGS`
Admin `
Text Societies are groups of mobs that are born weak, and grow in power.
They are placed in certain areas around the world. Once a society
creature exists, it has a chance every 5 minutes or so of increasing
in power and becoming a new creature. When it does this, it keeps
all of its current equipment, and it can load new equipment. See
neriks for an example of this.

To get a list of all the societies, type society list

To count the number of society members type society count.

You can qualify the last two with society list/count name and restrict
yourself to certain names.

To see detailed info on a society type society show <number>.

To update a society, type society update <times> <vnum>
If the times is blank, it assumes 1. If the vnum is optional,
it assumes all at once, not just one. 

To copy a society create the target society and type
society copy <oldvnum> <newvnum>

To edit a society type soci edit <number> or soci create to make
a new society.

To clear the society cities and to clear out all generated 
societies, type society clearall. Then, after next reboot, you
can regenerate the societies.


$9Societies will not save if they have the NUKE flag set, or if they
are destructible, have 0 population, and a 0 chance of their "child"
caste producing new members. This is so that when societies spawn new
populations, and those populations are wiped out (since they're
set to destructible automatically), they don't save and I won't
have to do cleanup. If you want them to save, tweak the code in
write_societies() in societyio.c to alter the conditions when a
society is saved.$7

Societies have a room_start which is the lower end of the starting
rooms where they can appear, and they have a room_end 
and they should appear in the rooms in that range.

Societies have several names associated with them.
name is the singular form of the society name. It is not used much
pname is the plural form of the name, it is used a lot.
aname is the "adjective" version of the society name which is mostly 
      used to describe the city that the society makes.

For example name: elf pname: elves aname: elven
I tried this with one name (the plural name) essentially and tried
to make it "singular" to deal with cities and it wasn't good enough
for me so you have to enter three names.

The adjective is some descriptive word like gray elf vs high elf vs
wild elf. It is not working yet. There is also code now where you
can generate societies just by giving the name and some basic
information.

The level or levels or level_bonus is a bonus to all society
members when they are created. The reason for this is when
a society gets taken over, it gets stronger to avoid stupid
stuff like an outpost that gets killed off every day since
it's too weak.

warrior_percent sets a number between 20 and 80 for how many warriors
the soceity should make. It alters the chances of certain castes being
picked by children "growing up".

generated_from sets what prototype this was generated from---
Don't set this by hand.

lifespan sets the average length (in game hours) that a society
member will live before dying of old age. When they die they
drop a corpse, so be careful with this.

raw <type/all> <number> sets the raw materials that the society wants.
The types are listed under help raw. The raw materials are in the form
current(wanted), in case they don't have enough to builder certain
things.

Flags are regular flags like you find on things, races, aligns and spells.
When you set flags, the society members get these flags set when they're
made.

society_flag <flagname> toggles flags that the society has. Flags include
                settler -- society makes new societies.
		aggressive -- battle castes attack all and raid.
		xenophobic -- battle castes attack all in society rooms.
		nuke -- do not save this society to disk. 
 		destructible -- 25% to destroy if reduced to 0 pop.
                noresources -- They don't collect resources. They get
                               their power from killing things. 
                fixed_align -- Cannot change alignments.
		nocturnal  --  Sleeps during the day.
		nosleep   --   Does not have a sleep cycle. 
		noname --      Members are not given generated names.
Goals are the things the society wants to build next hour.

Quality is something that makes the mobs higher level when they're
created.

$9There are several timers in societies: raid, alert, settler. You can
set them independently so the society can do many things at once.$7

You can type raid and then one of the following things to set:

hours <number>: Number of hours left in the raid before things go
home.

setup_hours <number>: the number of hours left to set up.

rally_point <number>: Where the mobs gather before raiding.

post <number>:       The room the mobs finally attack in the raid.

society <number>:    The number of the society they're attacking.


Alerts are now different. Type the following to modify them:

alert <number> Sets the alert level.

                    go a lot higher than the last alert to trigger

alert_hours <number> The number of horus left in the alert.

alert_rally_point <number> Where alerted mobs gather before attacking.

settle_hours <number> gives the number of hours before the society

alife_growth <number> Gives the bonus percent to the alife growth
		      routines.

the way you edit them is the following. You type 

<word> <1-10> <amount>

where word can be any one of the following:

start:     what the first mob in the caste is.
max_pop:   what the max pop of that caste is.
max_tier:  what the max tier of that caste is (number of diff mobs in it)
curr_tier: what the current tier of that caste is...
cflag:      set or remove a flag.
           cflags are warrior, worker, builder, healer, wizard,
	   leader, shopkeeper
  

base_chance: Change the chance that this caste is picked when a society member
           turns into. NOT percents anymore. Now all the chances for all
	   the castse are added up and a random number is picked out of
           the sum of these numbers, and then wherever that number lands
           in the list of numbers is where the new member grows into.

chance:    Change the current chance to something. These move around
           a little bit if the society needs more/less
           warriors/workers. They do eventually settle back down to
           the base_chance.

<num> or leave the num out and it will update them all once.

Key ACT`
Admin `
Text Act is this nice little function that sends messages to things in the
room.  I hated the way this was imped on Emlen's code, so one of the
reasons I wrote this new stuff is so I could write this function
correctly.  That means 1. No void* pointer junk and 2. There is a
TO_ALL option so all that TO_CHAR TO_VICT TO_NOTVICT stuff can be
avoided. It is really a simple function. You basically take a string
and go down the list of contents in a thing. For each thing on the
list, you check if it is an appropriate viewer. If not, you continue,
else you parse the buffer replacing certain symbols with words and
names based on the viewer, and the arguments to the function.  This
formatting is used to make channels, damage messages, spell messages,
and socials.

The prototype looks like:

act (char *buf, THING *th, THING *use, THING *vict, char *txt, int
type);

char *buf is the thing that gets parsed over and over.

This is a list of the replacements.

$0-$F give color codes just like in help colors.

@s at the end of a string will change singular words to plural EXCEPT
when the viewer == the sender.

@t gets replaced by the char *txt in the argument list.

@1, @2 and @3 access th, obj, and vict in the arguments (the first,
second and third THING's in the arguments.

When a thing is accessed, the next letter determines what gets sent:

n sends the name (short desc) of the thing.

m sends him/her/hit/your

p sends the possessive name of the thing

s sends his/her/its/your

h sends he/she/it/you

f is special. If you use @3f and th == vict, then it sends
himself/herself/itself/yourself, otherwise it acts like @3n.  This is
useful for spells so you don't see

"Bob surrounds Bob with a warm glow."

but instead you see

"Bob surrounds himself with a warm glow."

Key SCRIPT SCRIPTING SCRIPTS`
Admin `
Text This is an introduction to scripts. The idea behind it is this.

When something happens in the game like movement, or communication or
giving or dropping, the things that are around the action get checked
for certain "triggers". If a proper trigger is found, then the trigger
checks whether the "code" associated with it exists or not.

Then, this code is copied to the trigger and an "event" gets made, and
is put into a list. This list is checked 10x a second, and all events
which have timestamps <= the current time get executed.

What you need to know is how the triggers work, and how the code
works. There are two sections, help TRIGGERS and help CODE.

Key BUILDERS BUILDING BUILDER BUILDER_RULES ADMIN_RULES`
Admin `
Text Building here consists of making areas for use within the game.

First, I give away the MUD code and the areas to whoever wants them.
You are free to download the MUD from www.sf.net/projects/genmud
and make your own areas on your own server and keep them secret.
If you make an area on this copy of the server, it will be given
out to whoever wants it and people may use your areas to make
money and you may not be given credit anywhere. I won't remove
areas you have made here if you ask, nor will I stop distributing 
them if you ask, so think carefully before you build here. You 
always have the option of making your own MUD using this  
codebase and running it on your own server where you pay for 
everything and decide what gets done with the areas you make.

While building, don't mess with other peoples' areas. Don't make
cheater items (like items which have more than one of weapon/armor/
ranged/powershield stats on them. $9Don't Make Gems$7. 

Also, if for some reason I did something stupid and let builders
online while players are online playing the game, don't interfere
with the players. If you are a level 110, then you can deal with
problems with the players, but don't pick fights with them or
anything. Also, $9Don't Make Gems$7. Don't hand out stuff to the
players or help them find corpses or anything. 

If you are a builder or admin, you aren't an "immortal" or a "god" or
anything retarded like that. You are just a person who has decided
to make stuff for the game, or decided to help run the game instead
of playing the game. The game should mostly run itself, and since
I have the final say in what gets done here, don't make promises
to the players that things will change. 

Now, with respect to building...you should be capable of writing,
and finishing projects you start, since building an area is like
writing a small book, or making a presentation. There are lots
of picky details, and it requires a lot of creativity, and some
parts aren't very fun. Also, before you start building, you should
type help edit and get an overview of how to make the things here
since it's different from other MUDs you may have built on before.

If you still want to build, write a note to lonath saying you want
to build, and you might get a builder position. Even if you don't
get one here, if you are serious about wanting to build, download
the MUD from www.sf.net/projects/genmud and you can set up your
own game.

Text The way to access triggers is to type


trigedit <triggername>

or

trigedit create <triggername>

trigedit list lists all of the triggers.

There are several parts to a trigger:

1. The name. This is set up when you make the trigger and can't be
changed.

2. The type...these are the following: timed, taken, moved, moving,
given, dropped, taken_from, get, leave, enter, creation, death,
say, tell, command, arrive, bribe.

3. Thing: this is the number of the thing that will run the script.

4. The timer, for timed scripts how many seconds pass before it is
executed again. Can be VERY CPU intensive.

5. Code: A string which tells which code chunk is used for this
script.  The code is copied to an event so that you can edit code
while an event is running, and it will use the old code until the
event is done.

6. Keywords: Depending on the type of script..if it is a given/dropped
script, the keyword is the number of the item. If it is a
communication script, it is the keyword in the phrase. If it is a
command script, the keyword is the command itself.

7. flags: typing interrupt will mean that someone can restart
the script by doing the original action again (even if its running).
leave_stop means that the script stops executing if the starter
gets away from the thing doing the script. i.e. leaving the room
or mob or dropping the object and leaving it behind.

edit code list lists all of the code chunks.

Note that scripts can only go 5 lines deep, and the code terminates
after 100 lines executed to avoid infinite loops.

There are several different kinds of code lines possible. I will
discuss some here, and put some others into other helpfiles.

1. label <labelname> This is a line which a goto statement looks for.

2. goto <labelname> This tells the script for label <labelname>, and
it jumps to that line if it exists.

3. wait <number> This tells the script to wait <number> seconds before
continuing execution.

4. call <codename> This tells the script to call a different piece of
code, execute it, and then return from it just like regular functions.

5. end or done This tells the script to exit (or if it was called from
another piece of code, it returns.

6. make <number> creates a thing of that number (if possible). If you
type make <number> > @t0-@t9 it makes a certain pointer in the event
equal to the value of the new thing. Useful for do lines.

7. nuke <number> nukes the first thing with that number in the room or
inventory of the script runner. If you type nuke @o, it nukes the
object used to initiate the script (in the case of drop/give scripts).

8. do <@r/@o/@u/@t0-@t9> <command string>. This sends the string to the
interpreter, and the thing attempts to execute it. This lets you have
say a mob that creates new "helpers" and then have the helpers attack
the person who started the script by doing

make 500 > @t0 do @t0 kill @snm

guild will control access to this information.

There are 10 guilds currently: warriors, wizards, healers, thiefs,

you join, and which tier you are advancing to.

Key VARIABLE VARIABLES`
Admin `
Text Variables in scripts come in several forms.

First, there are the internal script numbers. These are all set to 0
when a script starts, and they are numbered @v0-@v9.

The other things that can be accessed in the scripts are the starter,
the runner, the object, and the (up to) 10 things made for the
scripts. The @u thing means several different things based on the runner.
If the runner is an area, @u is a random thing in a random room in
the area. If the runner is a room, @u is a random thing in the room.
If the runner is worn, @u is what is wearing the runner. Otherwise,
@u is a random thing inside the same thing as the runner.

You access these "things" by using the strings @s, @r, @o, @u, and @t0-@t9
respectively.

However, you don't just stop with naming these things, you also need
to specify what piece of the thing data you want to look at.

See help VAR_REP for a list of these things.


For example:

@rnm gives the name of the runner.

@sqf:farm1:3 gives the value of the third variable in the scriptflag
called "farm1" on a PC, and nothing if its not a PC.

an  align name
bk  bank amount
g:<first 3 chars of a guild> accesses that character's guild tier. 
g:all lists all guild tiers at once
ip:<part name> accesses the implant level for that part.
ip:all lists all of the tiers of all of the implants
mm  max mana 
mc  current mana

srb  spell resist bonus
sta  thief attack bonus
sdf  defense bonus (+dodge/parry etc...)
skd  kickdam bonus
sdr  damage resistance bonus
sga  groundfight attack bonus
sgd  groundfight defense bonus

Values are different. Use the format

v:<valuename>:<0-6 or w>.

This accesses the value0-value6 or the word. You can therefore
set specific items to have special value stats, like improving
a long sword or making a gem better or some such crap. This is
powerful so plz don't mess with it and screw things up. :)
You can also access the value timer by puttig ti or timer in there.

Questflags are different.  To access quest flags, you must do

qf:<flagname>:<0-5>

The qf says this is a questflag, the flagname tells which questflag it
is (and it gets created) and the 0-5 tells which variable you are
accessing. Note that this is much nicer than regular flags...you have
actual variables, so please if you are a builder use all of them up,
before you go off and make new flagnames. Plz try to keep them in the
form like lon1 lon2 lon3, the first few letters of your name followed
by a 1, 2, 3 in order as you use them up. Also, if you have say a
sevreral stage script, you can check if a certain script variable is
equal to a number or not to determine if you are supposed to do
something special at this point.

Trigger: farm1     ,   Type: say       ,   Thing: 5700

Code: farm1     ,   Keywords: yes

This means it is a say trigger, and thing 5700 runs it, and the
actual code is farm1, and the keyword is "yes".

The farm1 code looks like this:

1> label start
2> @v0 = @v0 + 1
3> do say this is number @v0.
4> if (@v0 < 10) 1
5> goto start
6> done

This is a simple loop indexed by @v0.

The output should look like this:

Farmer Al says 'this is number 1'
Farmer Al says 'this is number 2'
Farmer Al says 'this is number 3'
Farmer Al says 'this is number 4'
Farmer Al says 'this is number 5'
Farmer Al says 'this is number 6'
Farmer Al says 'this is number 7'
Farmer Al says 'this is number 8'
Farmer Al says 'this is number 9'
Farmer Al says 'this is number 10'


You can also set data on things in scripts. 

Take the ref1 trigger:
Trigger: ref1      ,   Type: say       ,   Thing: 500
Timer: 0,  Flags: 0 
Code: ref1      ,   Keywords: ref

1> do say I have @rhc out of @rhm hps.
2> @rhm = @rhm + 1000
3> do say I have @rhc out of @rhm hps.
4> @rhc = @rhm
5> do say I have @rhc out of @rhm hps.

outputs 

A test mob says 'I have 238235 out of 238235 hps.'
A test mob says 'I have 238235 out of 239235 hps.'
A test mob says 'I have 239235 out of 239235 hps.'

Key ALIAS ALIASES`
Admin `
Text These things let you store a command, or a string of commands which
can be accessed with a short keyword.

These aliases are processed before the interpreter, so it is possible
to override commands like kill.

You can have up to three arguments in your aliases, and they should be
entered as @1 @2 and @3, which are then replaced with new strings you
determine. Note that the regular quote ' around a string of words
makes all of those words into a single argument, just as with
spellcasting.

To enter an alias, you type

alias <aliasname> <alias string>.

To see a list of aliases, type alias.

To clear an alias that already exists, either type alias <keyword>, or
alias <number>. Note: If you have an alias which is actually a number,
alias <number> will remove the alias which has a keyword called that
number, and the alias numbered that will remain. Of course, if you do
it twice, the second time around, the alias numbered that value will
be deleted.

If you want to replace an alias, just type alias <keyword> <new alias>
and will overwrite the old alias.

You currently have 40 alias slots available.

If you wish to put more than one command into an alias, you need to
separate the aliases with a *.

Example 1.

alias cc c 'magic missile' @1

If you type cc enemy, the string that gets sent to the interpreter is

c 'magic missile' enemy

Example 2.

alias x n*e*s*e*e*n*open branches*u

The following commands get sent to the interpreter, and they are
executed 10 per second until they are all done:

n e s e e n open branches u

Example 3.

alias 22 tackle @1*say @2*l @3

If you type 22 enemy 'You suck!' 2.enemy

You will perform the commands

tackle enemy say You suck!  l 2.enemy


Also a quick note, if you want to enter several commands at once
without using an alias, say you want to pass an aggro mob, you can use
the backwards quote (below the tilde), and when you type this
character in, the game reads it as a newline, so again you can stack
commands if you wish to. This character replaces the ~ from Dikus,
since ~ may be useful later in scripts.


And finally, if someone gives me a compelling reason to do so, I can
add more replacement strings easily, but I just couldn't think up any
real reason to do so.

Text Hi, welcome to what may become the most addictive thing you have
encountered on the internet. What are MUDs? Well, I think of them as
chat rooms combined with games, which can become a daily part of your
life (like watching a soap...except you're IN the soap).

Most of them are based on fantasy or science fiction, since most of
the creators are umm... well... kind of nerdy. I am no exception, and
so this is based on fantasy, but could be changed to fit another
theme.

So, what is the idea of a MUD? The idea is you make a character and
travel around in a virtual world and do stuff. This might not sound
interesting, but the idea is you improve your character by doing
things, and you improve the character. You will spend time collecting
items, fighting with things, solving puzzles, and chatting with other
people. Some MUDs are strict about "roleplaying"...which I find
annoying, so if you wanted to, you could literally log on and chat
with other people, and never actually try to "play" the game here. You
could also log on and play the game by yourself and never interact
with anyone...but that is very hard to do.

Key MATH_PARSE`
Admin `
Text Here is the way the parser works. You can enter mathematical
expressions (using whole numbers) like

3 + (6*7)

and they are evaluated. You can also add a few kinds of variables.

The math parser looks like int (math_parse (char *txt, int val)

So, it takes a number as an argument, and the text string to be
interpretted.

The number val is accessed by using 'l' in the parser. Why?
because this was set up for use with spells, and spells are
generally level based :P This is also the code used in SCRIPTS
for assignment lines and mathematics in there too.

You can also use the letter 'd' in the math parser and it will
change that into a value from 1 to val.

You can also put things of the form r(a,b), like r(10,25) and it
will give a random number from 10 to 25.

You can only use + - / and * in the parser, and all operations are
performed IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY ARE WRITTEN!!, however
you can put parentheses around pieces of the string and
those parts will be processed first.

For example:

3 + 5 * 6 equals 8 *  6 = 48.

3 + (5 * 6) = 33.

d/2 gives a random number from 1 to val then divided by 2.

r(10,50) gives a random number from 10 to 50.

You can also try out combinations with random values by
using the checkparse function.

The checkparse function is used by typing

chp <val> <string>.

The val is what number 'l' represents in the string. It does
the operation 10 times so you can get an idea what kind of numbers
are going to be outputted

For each point the player is below these min stats, they can prac 5
 percent less on the spell. Minimum prac percent is 30.

time <num>: Time it takes to cast: 10 = 1 second, 18 = 1 combat round.

target <defensive/offensive/self/anyone>: Sets what kind of spell this
is.

trans -- you set this number and it determines what kind of spell you
have.  0 == recall, 1 == teleport, 2 = summon, 3 = inverse summon (caster
goes to the victim) anything above 3 sends the caster to that room
number (and it must be a room). The nosummon and norecall flags
counteract some of these options. Essentially, norecall means the person
moving cannot start in this room. Nosummon means a person doing the
casting cannot summon someone to them.

 does nothing.

hp_regen <num>  Set these to something other than 0 and it alters your  
mv_regen <num>  hp regen rate and your mv regen rate.

mana_bonus <num> Set this to something nonzero and it changes the

relic_room <num> Sets the relic room of an alignment
ascend_room <num> Sets the ascend room for a race.

want to have stuff that does more than one thing. For example, a boat
you can pick up and then drop onto the ground and sail into the ocean.
Maybe you want a tank you can enter and shoot stuff out of.  Maybe
you want a sword that talks to you and sends you on a quest.  Maybe
you want a gemsword.

Whatever you want, the dikuesque code is very limiting, and not only
that, but I was not allowed to release the old code I had since emlen
didn't want me to. So, I decided to start over to do this...so
if you are used to that style of code..bear with me as I explain this
idea.

Now, all mobs/objs/rooms/areas are "things". A thing is just a
database element which has attributes which determine what it can and
cannot do.

The way things interact with each other is discussed in help
THING_FLAGS.

The way the world is set up is this. There is a thing called
"the_world".
 Its contents are the things which are AREAS. Each area then has
 contents which are "prototypes" of other things. Since we only have
 one copy of rooms, those are used directly in the game. With the
other things, the prototypes are edited, then copies are made for
 use in the game.

So, every "movement" of a thing involves 4 things. Sometimes some of
these are the same. For example, enter/leave/n/e/w/s/u/d all have
mover == initiator.

Get has initiator == end_in.

Drop has initiator == start_in, and so forth.

So, what I did was essentially restrict when things can be moved
around in certain ways. To put these attributes onto a thing, type
thing <name> when you are editing a thing, and these flags will be set

no_can_get: This thing cannot reach out and get something from

no_move_by_other: This thing cannot be the mover for a different

Now, edit create checks if the number you pick is already in an area.
If the thing already exists, it lets you edit the existing thing.

If you are editing an area, there are a few special things to note.
 The ac of the area is a number (set to 500 to start), and the level
 is a number (set to 1000) to start.

The ac tells how many "rooms" the area has, and all things created
 between area->vnum and area->vnum + area->ac are made into "rooms".
 All other things after the rooms are regular things.

These numbers can be changed, but there is some checking and be
careful so you don't mess things up. It may require some tweaking to

 right.

align: Sets the alignment of the thing, 0 = neutral, 1-? = pc aligns.

cost: Cost when this is bought/sold...randomized when it is cloned.

color: This tells what color this thing is on the overhead map. See
 help COLORS for more info on how this works.

desc: Sets the thing's description. You can use copyfrom (number) and
      copyto (number) to either copy another thing's description or
      to copy this thing's description to another, respectively.

done: Ends the editing session (wsave changed saves things.)

eds edesc extra_description ex_description:

These let you edit the extra description of a thing.

edesc delete <name> deletes the edesc with this keyword.
edesc add <names> lets you add an edesc with those names.
edesc <name> <new name> lets you replace an edesc with an older
name with a newer list of names. You have to do all at once unfortunately.
edesc <name> desc lets you edit the description for this name.

 the bitvectors, or a number for the affects.

Also, flag <type> delete

You can only have one flag of any one type on a thing you are editing.

Key THING_FLAGS`
Admin `
Text Thing flags give the most important information about an item.  They
determine how this thing can interact with other things through
movement and other methods.

You alter them by typing thing <flagname> while editing a thing.


no_take:                Another thing cannot move this.  
no_move_self:           This cannot move itself.  
no_contain:             Nothing can be put or move into this.  
no_drag:                This cannot be dragged around.  
no_given:               Cannot give to this.  
no_drop:                Cannot drop this.  
no_can_get:             It cannot get anything.
no_move_by_other:       Other things cannot move this.  
no_take_from:           Other things cannot remove stuff from this.  
no_move_into:           Other things cannot move themselves into this.  
no_leave:               Other things cannot leave this.  
no_fight:               You can't start a fight with this.  
no_talk:                It cannot communicate.  
marked:                 for internal use.  
no_remove:              Cannot remove this if it's worn.  
is_room:                Is a room. Cannot be toggled.
unseen:                 Cannot be seen without holylight.  
is_area:                Is an area. Cannot be toggled.  
nuke:                   The prototype for this will not save.   
no_peek:                Looking at it, you cannot see inside.  
script:                 This has a script associated with it.

Thing flags are set differently than other flags. They are separate
because they are necessary, whereas all other kinds of flags are
optional.

To set a thing flag, type thing <keyword> and it will be toggled.

You should not really be setting thing flags on areas or rooms, so
that leaves mobjects. There is an editing shortcut called setup and if
you type setup obj or setup mob, it sets up the appropriate flags for
that kind of thing. You can also play with the thing_flags in
mobjects..for example a container is an object that doesn't have
no_contain set. You can make mobs you can pick up and wield to use a
weapons (5507). Use your imagination, but plz keep the funny stuff down a
little so the players don't get confused and start whining to me :P

Key FORGE`
Admin `
Text The forge command lets you create items out of chunks of minerals
you can mine in certain locations in the world. It has been said
that mining within the safety of your homelands will not garner
any minerals, and that locations can be mined out.

To forge equipment, you must follow several steps. You must
first find a forge someplace in the world. Then, you must find
a hammer and an anvil to use to forge the equipment. You must
also get enough chunks of minerals to mine the equipment.

The following types of minerals can be mined and turned into
equipment:

brass, copper, iron, steel, silver, gold, platinum, obsidian,
mithril and adamantium.

The more rare the mineral, the better the created equipment will be.

You can forge the following types of items:

anvil, hammer, helmet, mask, (breast) plate, vambraces, gauntlets,
shield, sword, mace, dagger, belt, greaves, boots.

Everything from helmet on will cost 8 chunks of the proper type to
make, and your hammer and anvil must be at least as powerful as the
type of mineral you are trying to forge into something.

A hammer of a certain rank can be forged with a hammer and anvil of
one rank lower quality.

An anvil of a certain rank can be forged with a hammer of the same
rank, and an anvil of one rank lower quality.

When you forge a hammer or an anvil, you lose the old hammer or
anvil. The cost of forging a hammer or anvil is 20 chunks.

You need many guilds at low tiers to learn to forge. Basically,
you need to have some magical knowledge, and knowledge of arms
to succeed at it. However, your rank within the Tinker's guild
will determine how powerful your items can be. The maximum rank of
mineral you can forge into an item is the following:

Tier 1: copper
Tier 2: steel
Tier 3: gold
Tier 4: obsidian
Tier 5: adamantium

Key VALUE VALUES`
Admin `
Text Ok, this is probably one of the most odd parts of this code. Values
are larger pieces of data that can basically represent anything. This
helpfile needs some work, as does editing values since I haven't made
it terribly user friendly yet.

The way to access them is to type

val <valtype> <v<0-5>> <number> or val <valtype> word <string> or val
<valtype> delete.


You can use prefixes like


v w v0 5000 would be the same as val wexit v0 5000.


See help DIG for a shortcut.

These are a list of the values:

nexit, sexit, eexit, wexit, uexit, dexit, iexit, oexit.

These are exits. The first 6 are regular exits from rooms to rooms.
The iexit means a portal. Check out obj 252 for an example.  The oexit
is a lid on a container, and doesn't really lead out.

for exits: v0 = to_room_num, v1 = door_flags (see help door_flags), v2 =
reset_door_flags, v3/v4 = curr/max str needed to break, v5 = trap, 
v6 = key needed to unlock.  the word is the door name like gate, door, 
lid, etc...

You can get a list of all exits to/from the area you are currently
in by typing exlist.


Outer exits are for climbable things. There are different values for
each so you can make an item which is climbable in several directions.

nouter, souter, wouter, eouter, uouter, douter, oouter, iouter.

These all work the same way, and atm v0 is just the room they move you
to. The syntax for climb is climb <item> <dir>.

weapon: v0 = min dam, v1 = max dam (NOT DICE!!!), v2 = type 0 = slash,
1 = pier, 2 = conc, 3 = whip. v3 = number of (extra) attacks. v4 =
number of poison shots left, v5 = poison number, word = attackname.
v3 can be + or - to make faster/slower wpns. Do not use v4/v5 on
wpns plz, since they are cheater. Feel free to make a few tough
mobs with v4/v5 tho...since then they will get some nasty initial
attacks in ;)

price decreases

shop2: leave all of these at 0. This allows players to own/run
       shops. v0 = the cost to buy the shop, v1 = the number of
       previous owners, word = name of owner. DO NOT USE THIS
       UNLESS YOU HAVE THE PREMISSION OF LONATH. THIS WILL BE VERY
       RARE WITHIN THE GAME SINCE IT IS PROBABLY REALLY CHEATER!!!!

teacher: v0-v5 = vnums of spells this teaches.
teach1:  v0-v5 = more spells taught
teach2:  v0-v5 = more stuff taught

money: v0 = copper, v1 = silver, v2 = gold, v3 = plat, v4 = obsid. Use
this to set money on mobs.

guard: v0 = flags (kind of guarding), v1-v3 = vnums of things guarded,
v4-v5 clan/sect type guarded and clan number guarded. The word has a
list of characters from newsud and these tell which direction(s) it
guards.

Here are the flags: 

guard_door = 1, guard_door_align = 2, guard_door_pc = 4,
guard_door_npc = 8, guard_door_society = 16,
guard_vs_above = 32 (as opposed to guarding below a number)

There is an exception to this. If v4 >= 10, it is not a clan/sect guard.
If v4 >= 10, and v5 > 0, then the thing acts as a guard vs levels
or hps or things like that. This is how that guard_vs_above/vs below
thing works. Normally, you have to have at least v5 amount of whatever
v4 represents, but if you guard vs above, then you have to have less
than that amount.

Here are the types of v4's you can have:

v4 = 10, guard vs level.
v4 = 11, guard vs remorts.
v4 = 12, guard vs mana.
v4 = 13, guard vs max mana.
v4 = 14, guard vs hp.
v4 = 15, guard vs max hp.
v4 = 16, guard vs bank account.
v4 = 40 to 40 + stat max (stats in order = str int wis dex con luc),  
         guard vs stat.
v4 = 60 to 60 + guild max (guilds in order = war wiz hea thi ran tin alch 
         kni myst) guard vs that guild tier (good for making guild houses).

So, for example v4 = 10 and v5 = 50 means you must be at least level
50 to pass this item in a direction it guards. If guard from above
is set, you have to be below level 50 to pass.



cast: v0-v6 casts these spells occasionally. If this is an item, it
casts on who is wearing it. If it is a mob, it casts attack spells on
what it's fighting, and healing spells on people of the same align in
the room. If it is a room, it casts healing spells on those within the
room of the same align, and attack spells on those of a different
align. This supersedes all the stupid ROOM_GASTRAP flags.

powershield: v1 = current_power, v2 = max_power, absorbs damage before
being drained.

map: v0 this is the room where the map is drawn...I am too lazy to
make maps by hand, so the computer does it automatically using the
same code as the "map" command. If people spam this and cause
bandwidth problems, I will just make maps one use or only a few uses.

guild: These are guildmasters. v0 is the type of guild.
To see what guilds go with what numbers, type guild 
and the game will show you a list of all the guilds and what
numbers go with them. So, type v0 3 to make it a healer's guildmaster.
v1 = min tier taught, v2 = max tier taught. This way, you can set up
quests for each tier. v2 = 0 means the guildmaster teaches all tiers.

randpop: These are used to make randomly popping items. It requires
you to make a block of items so that the first K are the worst, followed
by K better ones, and K even better ones etc. v0 = the vnum where
you start popping stuff v1 = number of elements per tier, v2 = number
of tiers. If v3 > 0, then you advance a tier if nr(1,v3) < level of
thing yo are resetting, otherwise if nr(1,v4) <= v5 you advance a tier.
Then, it attempts to load the item you tell it to. If the value v6 
is nonzero, then the way it works is that you have v1 types of items
in v2 tiers, but the types of items are next to each other, as the
gems are...so you get the 4 diamonds first, and you can do a randpop
for gems in such a way that the first tier is the lowest level gems,
and the second is the next higher level etc...

madeof: These will be used someday if I ever get the society needs
code working. It will be a process in v0 followed by several
ingredients that are needed to make this item.

replaceby: If this thing times out, then when it gets destroyed,
it gets replaced by whatever thing is picked. The form for telling
what gets created in its place is the same as the randpop code.

craft: Used internally to keep track of crafted items.
     v0 = base_proto vnum -- raw materials used for this.
     v1 = prototype vnum -- what general item generates items in this
          class.
     v2 = made from proto, what is the prototype for the item that 
          makes this thing.

daily_cycle: Used internally to make mobs walk from their home to
     work and back again during the day.

Key DIG`
Admin `
Text Dig is a shortcut to the values used when making rooms,
since most values are exits. To use it, you must be in a room. You can
type

e dig <number>,

which will do val eexit v0 <number> and find out if that other
numbered room exists, and if it does, it makes a val wexit v0 <your
current number> in there. If not, it creates the room and does the
wexit. In either case, you end up in the new room. Dig only works if
the target and destination are from the same area.

Also, if you just type e dig, the game will look for the next unused
room IN THE SAME AREA!!! and it will create it and it will set up the
exits and it will send you to the next room. This means you can have
aliases for fast building.

do aliases like

alias ee e dig @1 alias ww w dig @1 alias ss s dig @1

etc... and you can build fast, since if you want to make a trail that
goes e e n n e n e e from where you are, you just type ee ee nn nn ee
nn ee ee and it makes the whole thing. You can also use the commands
like e d and w d and so forth which does the same things. 


You can get a list of all exits to/from the area you are currently in
by typing exlist.

Key RESET RESETS`
Admin `
Text Typing reset loc vnum will give you all the resets for the thing
with that vnum.


Since everything is now a thing, resets have been redone. They are
VERY recursive so you need to be careful. They come in a few
varieties.

First, there are resets on a thing which is not an area and not a
room.  These resets get called every time that thing is copied. For
example, if you had a guard numbered 32543 and you wanted to load 5
pieces of armor on it, you could put the resets on it, and every time
that guard number 32543 is created, it resets those armors on it. (And
if those armors contained other things then with each instance of
making a new thing, the inner objects are also cloned...this is why it
is so dangerous and powerful.  $9Do not mess around with this.$7 I will
delete you real fast if you mess around with this to see "how many
things" you can make up with this.  I refuse to put checks on this
because I demand that the builders here not be morons.


Now, this is more powerful since you can put one reset in a room

reset 1 32543 100 10 1

and it will reset 10 copies of that guard, all equipped.


The syntax is reset <number> delete

or

reset <number> <thing_number> <percent> <max_number> <nest>.



Resets in rooms reset things in that room up to the max number allowed
in
 that room.

Note: these max_in_world (miw) from EDIT are HARD CODED!! You cannot
load more copies of something even with the make command once you have
 gone beyond the miw. Also, as of now, limited does not work per
se. It does not count things on pc's stored in pfiles.


Resets in _AREAS_ take the reset thing and put it randomly into one of
the rooms in that area. If you wish to restrict the placement to a
room with a certain "sector type" like water, underground, inside,
easymove, forest, rough, airy, fiery etc...you must set that room flag
on the thing you want to reset too. If you have several room flags in
the room, and several on the mob... (out of the previous list), it
will place that mob only in rooms of that type.

If you put a reset into start.are, then it will repop randomly
in a random area (subject to room types), so you can do
worldwide resets if you wish.

Area resets also limit the number of things by the number in that area.
Therefore, if you are making a forest and you don't feel like making
wolves or deer or something, you can just pick a mob from another
area and reset several copies of it in your area.

Also, note that there are random repop items. When these are reset,
they don't appear themselves. They tell the game to load a certain
thing with a different number. They are highly dependent on how
the things you make are ordered within your area. A few examples
of this can be found by looking at the standard armors, weapons and
gems. They have their randpop items (tfind pop) and these items
repop random items based on the level of the mob they are popping on.
The randpop value (in edit use val rand...) has several numbers.
v0 is the vnum of the first thing in the list of randpop things,
v1 is the number of elements in each "tier" of the randomly
popping items, v2 is the number of tiers. If v3 is nonzero, then you
advance a tier when a random integer from 1 to this number is no more
than the level of the thing you are popping in. If v4 and v5 are nonzero,
then the rank of the item advances whenever nr(1,v4) < v5. If the word
is "interlaced" then the way the items are set up is different. In
the non-interlaced setup, all the crap items come first, then
the better ones etc... like armors and weapons. If you make it so
that all tiers of a specific type of item come first, then for
a different item come second...like gems, you type 
val rand word interlaced to set this up. 

If you just have N items you want to pop one of randomly,
make v0 the start number, v1 the number of items, v2 = v3 = v4 = v5 = 0.
This might be useful if you have say 50 kinds of herbs and you want to
randomly pop them, but don't feel like making resets for all of them.

If you have several ranks of one specific item you want to pop,
make v0 the start number, v1 = 1, v2 = num_ranks, and set up v3,
v4, v5 however you need it to work. This is useful for things like
mining where people pop random chunks of metal...that way the 
crap metals are more common than the better ones.

Again, these are all recursive...so be careful please.

Key MANA MANATYPES MANA_TYPES GEM GEMS`
Admin `
Text Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Spirit. You need these to cast spells.

The mana function shows you your current mana and level in each of the
spheres of magic.

Gems work in the following way. For each color, your max casting level
is your natural casting level plus the HIGHEST gem level which is of
that color. $9Gem casting level is capped at TWICE your natural
level!$7

Your mana for that color is your natural mana plus ALL mana from ANY
gem which is of that color.

So, if you have nat level of 25 and 50 nat mana. You wield a level 20
fire gem with 60 mana, and a level 10 fire gem with 30 mana.

Your fire mana level is then 25 + 20 (max gem level, up to twice nat
level).

Your fire mana total is 50 + 60 + 30 = 140.

HELP MORT
Key RULES2`
Admin `
Text Ok, let's go over these rules in a little more detail.

1. This one is just here so that if it becomes necessary, I can do
what I must for the game if it seems like it needs it.

$9I may hold each member of a clan responsible for the actions of
an individual clan member if the clan appeared to get some
benefit from that individuals' actions.$7

$9Don't try to lawyer me or BS me. Seriously, I've seen so much
shit that if I get a bad feeling about what you're saying, I'll 
just stop you right there and assume that you did something wrong.$7

2. This one is a biggie for me. No multiplaying AT ALL.  This means no
looking over someone else's shoulder, no having access to your
brother/roomate's password to swap eq or pop that big mob, no
characters on opposite alignments, and no "storage characters" which
are just logged on for short periods of time and kept in safe places
to store good eq or anything else you might think of to get around
this rule. Storage characters are not allowed even if they are
played by your roomate who doesn't play but who logs on for you just
to deal with eq. I am really mean and very willing to delete people
who play games with this rule or who try to lawyer me into believing
their BS that they weren't multiplaying.

Don't believe I'm serious about this?

I deleted Devlin for multiplaying Mig because 6 months previously, at 
5am Devjr logged for 5 minutes from the same site where Mig played.

I deleted a whole clan for having a character that was "technically" 
played by someone, but in reality was passed around to almost everyone 
in the clan for storage of forging equipment.

Ask Eertu and Gausser and the clan of Tards :P about that. If you and
a bunch of people play from the same site or house, play on the same
alignment. I will not do alignment changes, and if you can't get it
together enough to all move to the same alignment when asked, you will
all be deleted. That's why the rule is stated the way it is. If you
somehow access or look at the output for more than one character, or
if you ever control more than one character, then you're cheating.

3. Of course don't try to crash the game, and if you do...explain how
 you did it so it can be fixed. If you find something that is giving
 waaay too much reward for too little effort, please tell
me. Otherwise, it gets everyone else pissed off. Also, if you ever
tell me there is a bug, and try to "hold out" or ask for a reward, or
you tell me someone told you a bug but they don't want to tell who it
is...  Delete and siteban. Sorry, but I don't like blackmail.


The game is set up as a multi-align pkill MUD. This means you should
not know who is on the other side (unless you use in-game methods),
nor should you know what they are doing. Don't share information
across alignments with other electronic methods of passing information
outside of the game e.g. AIM, ICQ, email, IRC, other MUDs, or any
other kind of outside communications. It just makes it lame as hell
for everyone.

These are also things not to do:

Swapping eq, spam dying, and excessive same-side pkill are out, since
they hurt the balance between the sides. Don't ever swap eq, and don't
leave the portal room too hurt to get into a pkill fight until you
have a bunch of your hps. I might code is so you need to heal halfway
or something to leave the portal, although I do know that sometimes
during raids you have to die a few times to kill some highbee with a
l33t set who is almost dead.  Wrt same-side pkill, I am more strict
about this when highbees attack and kill newbies they don't like. Try
ignore first. If you think the newbie is a spy, tell the admins first
before you go and kill that person.


Also, I don't usually hassle people about what they say, but I don't
like too much profanity and abusive language. I don't think I have
ever deleted anyone for this, but I may have silenced people once in a
while when they got out of hand.


And finally, if you manage to find some loophole which makes a lot of
people pissed, and I feel that it is harmful to the game, you may be
punished retroactively, and changes made to code out that activity, or
to just make it forbidden...and add it to the rules.  Also, rewards
you have gained by doing that may be removed. I know this paragraph
sucks, and I don't want to ever have to do this, but it may be a
possibility...I just don't know.

Key RULE RULES POLICY POLICIES`
Admin Don't mess with morts or interfere unless it really seems necessary.
You cannot have a mort, sorry.

`
Text These are the rules. Punishment usually means deletion, or a siteban.

1. Admin decisions are final, and any aspect of the game can be changed
   at any time, and you don't have a right to be here.

2. No player shall ever use or have access to more than one character,
   and no character shall ever be used or be able to be accessed
   by more than one player. This includes no selling/swapping/giving
   away of characters. 

3. Do not interfere with the game. This includes helping another
   alignment in any way, using crash bugs, or other bugs that
   seem to give too much reward for too little effort, or excessive
   same-side or clan pkilling. This also includes too much foul
   or offensive (as deemed by me) language.

HELP MORT
Key GUIDELINES`
Admin Please try to follow these guidelines. Don't interfere
with morts plz.  
`
Text Ok, the rules suck. I sound like a hardass. If you ask people around
tho, I really don't enforce rules too often, nor do I interfere much.
I have been doing this for a few years now, so the "novelty" of being
a k3wl g0d has worn off. I also have learned to back off when people
ask me to change things, and usually if you ask me to change
something, I will say no. This isn't to be a dick, it's mainly because
my reaction is not to mess with things. 

I don't like making changes to characters. I don't expect I will ever
do a reimburse, even if it's for some bug that makes you lose a set.
I may, if say, an admin deletes you for no good reason, but that's
about it. $9Note that this will NEVER apply to permadeath
characters.$7 I also won't do things like guild/race/align changes.  I
also won't be doing retirements, since it gets to be a pain, and
people always want their chars back and there's a lot of switching and
bitching and whining. Basically, if I do them for one person, I have
to do them for all, and I would have to do them whenever people want
them.

Also, I do not automatically side with the admins. I have seen so many
stupid, powerhungry, a-hole admins that I will believe the players if
they seem to have a credible story. However, if you are an annoying
brat player, and I get to dislike you, I will tend to discount your
complaints. It sucks, but that's the way it is, and you now have fair
warning. Finally, I do have the final say in these things, so if
some admin is messing with you, please email me at
johna@wam.umd.edu. Of course, if your problem is with me...well that's
not good, but at least give it a shot. However, if it is a rule
breaking problem, and I caught you, you have almost no chance of
appealing. I have had soo many people lie to me before I wore them
down, with evidence to the point that they admitted their infraction
(usually some form of multiplaying), that I have a really sensitive
nose for BS, (Read the stuff on lawyerly reasoning above), and
I don't put up with it.

Ok, and after all that, it is real easy to stay on my good side.
Just play your character, and only your character, help out your
alignment, and make the other alignment miserable by pkilling them,
and have fun!

Key MAPGEN`
Admin `
Text Mapgen is lots of fun. Mapgen lets you create small chunks of maps.
Mapgen is rasterizing code on steroids.

To use mapgen, you can do the following:

mapgen clear/delete/nuke -- this clears the current map you have generated.

mapgen show <playername> -- this lets you see your own generated map if
                            you give it no argument, or someone else's map
                            if you input their playername. This way you
                            can inspect other people's interesting maps.
                            $9MAPGEN MAPS DON'T SAVE!$7

mapgen make/generate/create <vnum> -- this attempts to make a mapgen that
                            you have already set up using the long mapgen
                            command using rooms starting at vnum. There
                            are several restrictions. If your current map
                            has num_rooms rooms in it (which is shown on
                            mapgen show). Ok, all of the things numbered
                            between vnum and vnum + num_rooms must be in
                            the same area. They must all be set up as
                            rooms, and _none_ of the things in that
                            range can exist. If all of these criteria are
                            satisfied, then the map gets generated using
                            real rooms.

The real mapgen command to make blocks of rooms looks like this.

mapgen dx dy length width fuzziness holeyness curviness

Ok, dx and dy essentially give the slope of the core line you want to make.
So, if dx = 4, and dy = 1, the map would go 4 spaces to the right for
every space it goes up 1. For a regular map, you may as well pick
dx = 1 dy = 0 or vica versa.

If dx = -3 and dy = 5, it goes 3 spaces to the left for every 5 spaces it
goes up.

The length is approximately how many spaces long the path will be. The
actual distances you go in the x and y dir are calculated by dividing
length by the proportion of (abs(dx) + abs(dy)) taken up by dx and dy.

If you do mapgen dx dy length 0 0 0 0

you will generate a simple path.

The width of the line is how wide the line is (perpendicular to the
direction of travel of the line). This lets you make fields. For
example, typing

mapgen 1 0 10 6 0 0 0 

will generate a field 10 wide and 6 high.


The fuzziness of the line is how much the width varies. The width
is equal to the previous width of the line plus a random number equal to
(nr (0, fuzziness) - nr (0, fuzziness)) with a few qualifications. If
the current width is larger or smaller than the original width, it has
a 1/3 chance of resizing the width to go back to the normal width. If
the width is less than 1, it is reset to 1. If the width is more than 2
units away from the previous width, it is reset to 2 units away from
the previous width.

So, what happens is you draw a pixel (room) and as you're drawing the 
width at that point, each point added must be checked against holeyness.
If nr (1,20) > holeyness, the pixel is added, otherwise it isn't added.
This makes some interesting maps, but it also tends to make them 
disconnected, so you have to be careful with this.


For one more level of randomness, curviness makes your straight lines
less straight. Normally, you have set positions where your line will
"jump up" to follow the slope of the line you specified. With curviness
greater than 0, whenever nr (1,50) < curviness, you get a jump. The
distance jumped is determined by how big the curviness is.

Then, there's another parameter which is the extra_lines
parameter. This is used to add extra paths into the map to make it
more connected. It's useful if you want a map with a lot of holes
in it, but still connected. 


You should try a certain set of parameters and see what comes up,
and after you get an interesting map, mapgen generate. Try using
small pieces you put together to make larger maps.

groundfighting with them. 

$9Powerful Mobs do a great deal of damage in groundfights so it
might not be a good idea to tackle them to try to reduce the damage
that they do.$7

Tackle is the base skill you use to tackle someone and the overpower
(which is automatically checked when you try to tackle someone) gives
you a greater chance of tackling that person. Not all creatures
can be tackled.

Knowledge of the grapple and grip skills make it harder for your
opponent to stand once you've tackled him or her.
