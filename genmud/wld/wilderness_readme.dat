This is how you can set up the wilderness map. I am assuming that you're
on a Linux machine using Xwindows.  In this directory,

type terraform

This will make the terraform program open up. Make a new picture 
(try out several kinds of generators).

 Set the size to whatever wilderness size you want I have found
that the scaling doesn't work too well, it scaled 500x500 up to
1997x1997 which isn't good. :P So, in my case I have to use
2000x2000 pictures. Make an interesting picture then edit it
with some of the advanced features, and then you save it. Save 
it as a grid file .grd, and call it wld.grd

(You must call the file wld.grd and have it in your wld directory
unless you want to edit the file in the next part.)

Now go to your src directory and type

gcc -o gridmaker grid.c fileio.c

Then type ./gridmaker 

and it will overwrite your current wilderness file with the
new one. 

Then, you can start the game up and use the wildernes map.
