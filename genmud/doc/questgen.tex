\chapter{Quest Generation}

\section{Fedex Quests}

The first quests I got working are auto generated fedex quests where you
go kill a mob and bring an item back to a person for a cash reward.

\section{Other Quests}

I am working on code to make better quests, but it's hard and I don't know
when it will work.
