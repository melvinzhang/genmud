In this readme, directions are given on regular lines and things
you type in a UNIX/Linux shell follow the % symbol. Don't actually
type the %. It means the % is your prompt and you type what comes
after it.

To get the game up and running type

% cd src
% make clean
% make
% ./scs &

There is no automatic "first character on is an imm" code.

So type telnet localhost 3300

Log in and create any old character. 

Quit out once it's made and type

% cd ../plr
% pico <playername>

Edit the level to be 110.

Go to the row HpMv 20 20 100 100 

and change it to HpMv 200000000 200000000 10000 10000

(The high hps are needed because there is no "immortal" code in
the game since it's too hard to get exactly right. Therefore,
everything is mortal, but some things (like you) can have up to
2 billion hps and so are basically unkillable.)

Then log in again and you have your "imm" character. 

The docs are in the doc subdirectory.

To create and view them type

% cd ../doc
% latex main
% xdvi main %


To make the MUD start up automatically on reboot, type the
following:

crontab -e
@reboot cd /home/yourusername/bfdmud/src; ./scs &
(Escape)  
:wq

where yourusername is the username you have. The path may not
quite be correct, but if not, then type pwd and see what
the path is to your home directory.

One more thing: everywhere you see "THING" in the code, it is
possibly a room, obj, mob, area, mob proto, or obj proto. I don't
make a distinction between these things so it may take a little
time to get used to it. Also, I would recommend skimming the docs
before you jump in, or you can just read this:

Briefly, the code consists of an infinite loop that repeatedly scans
for input, updates objects, and sends output. Things are not updated
in big chunks, but instead there are "events" that get queued up
and fired so that the load gets balanced out. Commands that you
can enter are in functions of the form do_xxxx and have to be
added to int.c before they can be accessed.

Also, to use the generation and simulation code do this.

Type

alias z worldgen 17 17
alias x worldgen generate 700
alias v worldgen clear yes
alias zz speedup foozball

Then type z and it should generate a map for you. If it doesn't
type v and reboot. Then type z.

After you type z a few times and see a map you like, type x.

That will generate the world, although it will take a minute or
two to do this probably. 

Then type soci list
Type zz

This will speed up the game dramatically.

Type soci count 

a few times as the game speeds along and look at the increasing
numbers. Typing soci <number> will let you edit a society.

After a while, if you type rumors, you will see a list of rumors
or events that societies generate as they do things. This is where
the players will get information on quests by typing "news". When
a player types news and a society member is in the room with them,
they get a chance of hearing about something that the society
knows or needs help with. 

Enjoy.
